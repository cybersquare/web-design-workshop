        <h2>Resignation</h2>
        <p>
            On January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple announced that he had been granted a medical leave of absence. Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made "so he could focus on his health". As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company.[197][198] While on leave, Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event on March 2, the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud on June 6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7.[199]

On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple's CEO, writing to the board, "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come."[200] Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO.[201][202] Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,[14][206][207] which resulted in respiratory arrest.[208] He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.[209] His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later.[209] A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public.[210]

            Apple[211] and Pixar each issued announcements of his death.[212] Apple announced on the same day that they had no plans for a public service, but were encouraging "well-wishers" to send their remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages.[213] Apple and Microsoft both flew their flags at half-staff throughout their respective headquarters and campuses.[214][215]
            
            Bob Iger ordered all Disney properties, including Walt Disney World and Disneyland, to fly their flags at half-staff from October 6 to 12, 2011.[216] For two weeks following his death, Apple displayed on its corporate Web site a simple page that showed Jobs's name and lifespan next to his grayscale portrait.[217][218][219] On October 19, 2011, Apple employees held a private memorial service for Jobs on the Apple campus in Cupertino. Jobs's widow, Laurene, was in attendance, as well as Cook, Bill Campbell, Norah Jones, Al Gore, and Coldplay.[220] Some of Apple's retail stores closed briefly so employees could attend the memorial. A video of the service was uploaded to Apple's website.[220]
            
            California Governor Jerry Brown declared Sunday, October 16, 2011, to be "Steve Jobs Day".[221] On that day, an invitation-only memorial was held at Stanford University. Those in attendance included Apple and other tech company executives, members of the media, celebrities, close friends of Jobs, and politicians, along with Jobs's family. Bono, Yo-Yo Ma, and Joan Baez performed at the service, which lasted longer than an hour. The service was highly secured, with guards at all of the university's gates, and a helicopter flying overhead from an area news station.[222][223] Each attendee was given a small brown box as a "farewell gift" from Jobs. The box contained a copy of the Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda.[224]
            
            Childhood friend and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,[225] former owner of what would become Pixar, George Lucas,[226] former rival, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates,[227] and President Barack Obama[228] all offered statements in response to his death.
            
            Per his request, Jobs is buried in an unmarked grave at Alta Mesa Memorial Park, the only nonsectarian cemetery in Palo Alto.[229][230]
            
            On October 7, 2021, Apple released a commemorative YouTube video on the tenth anniversary of Jobs's passing</p>
